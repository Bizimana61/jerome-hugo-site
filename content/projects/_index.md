# Projects

Below are short descriptions of projects I built while learning software engineering and UI/UX design. I emphasize clarity, accessibility, and secure design in my work.

## UI Prototype — Classroom Tools

I built a small interactive prototype to help instructors visualize student progress and to let students give quick feedback. The prototype focuses on clear affordances, keyboard accessibility, and quick iteration.

## Static Analyzer — Mini Security Tool

A lightweight static analyzer that checks small patterns in student code to demonstrate simple secure-by-design checks. It's a learning tool showing how automated checks can prevent common mistakes.
