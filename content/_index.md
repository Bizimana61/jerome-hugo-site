## Welcome to Jerome's site

Welcome — I'm glad you're here. This site is for people who want to learn how to build thoughtful, useful software and interfaces. I publish short project writeups, practical prototypes, and learning materials that explain how I approach design, engineering, and security in real projects. The content is updated regularly with new examples, notes, and resources aimed at curious learners and collaborators.

Below is a short bit about me and what I work on.

## Jerome Bizimana

I'm Jerome, a Junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science with a focus on software engineering, UI/UX design, security design, and foundations. I build usable tools, prototype interfaces, and think carefully about security and trustworthy systems. My work emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and pragmatic solutions that can be iterated on quickly.

What you'll find here:

- Concise project pages with problem statements, approaches, and outcomes.
- Short posts and notes on engineering and design decisions.
- Links to code, demos, and prototypes you can try.

If you want to learn more or collaborate, use the contact links below — I check messages regularly and welcome inquiries about projects, internships, research collaborations, or freelance design/engineering work.
