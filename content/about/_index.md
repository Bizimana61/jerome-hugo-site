# About

I'm Jerome Bizimana — a Junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science. I like to build small, focused tools and prototypes that solve real problems. I balance engineering systems with attention to interface and security.

## Background

I work on projects that sit at the intersection of software engineering and UI/UX design. I enjoy prototyping fast, testing assumptions with users, and iterating toward clarity.

## Reach out

If you'd like to collaborate, see my code, or talk about an opportunity, email me at [Jeromebizimana2027@u.northwestern.edu](mailto:Jeromebizimana2027@u.northwestern.edu) or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/Bizimana61) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerome-bizimana).

## Education & current status

- Northwestern University — B.S. Computer Science (expected 2027)
- Focus: Software engineering, UI/UX design, security design, and foundations

## How I work

- I prefer small, testable prototypes that communicate intent quickly.
- I prioritize clarity and accessibility in UI design and pragmatic, well-tested code in engineering.
- In security work I focus on simple, preventative checks and clear developer guidance rather than heavyweight tooling.

If you'd like a short chat about a project, class collaboration, or internship, send a quick note to my email and I will follow up.

## Skills

- Programming: Python, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML/CSS
- Tools & frameworks: React (planned), Django (planned), Vite, Monaco Editor
- Design: interaction design, prototyping, Fluent UI patterns, accessibility
- Other: Git, basic DevOps concepts, user testing & research

## Selected coursework

- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Software Engineering Practices
- Computer Security (introductory)

## Availability

I am actively looking for project collaborations and internship opportunities for the coming summers. I respond quickly to email and GitHub issues — feel free to reach out with a short note describing the opportunity.

## Current project

- Cursor IDE Redesign — HCI project (prototype and design notes): https://github.com/Bizimana61/Cursor-Redesign
